Once upon a time a programmer walked around a classroom while teaching his students, decided to tease them a little.  
As he raised a glass of water, everyone expected they would be asked the typical glass half empty or glass half full question.  
Instead, with a smile on his face, the programmer asked, How heavy is this glass of water I am holding?
